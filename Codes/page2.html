<ul>
    <li1><p><b>Mad Libs Generator</b></p></li1>
</ul>
    <p1>
        The objective of this project is to develop a Mad Libs Generator python project.
        <br>In this project, the user first has to pick a story by the title of the story.
        <br>Then the user has to enter specific words like a noun, adverb, verb, food, adjective, etc, according to the requirements. And then the story will be generated.
        <br>This is a python project for absolute beginners and is developed using the basic concept of python and tkinter.

<ul>
    <li2><p><b>Number Guessing Game</b></p></li2>
</ul>
    <p2>
        This is one of the simple python projects yet an exciting one. You can even call it a mini-game.
        <br>This project is particularly useful for beginners.
        <br>Make a program in which the computer randomly chooses a number between 1 to 10, 1 to 100, or any range.
        <br>Then give users a hint to guess the number.
        <br>Every time the user guesses wrong, he gets another clue, and his score gets reduced.
        <br>The clue can be multiples, divisible, greater or smaller, or a combination of all.

<ul>
    <li3><p><b>Text-based Adventure Game</b></p></li3>
</ul>
    <p3>
        This is a basic version of the Adventure game.
        <br>It is completely text-based. 
        <br>In this version of the game, users can move about through different rooms within a single setting, and based on the user input, it will provide descriptions for each room.
        <br>This is one of th e more interesting python projects for beginners.

<ul>
    <li4><p><b>Dice Rolling Simulator</b></p></li4>
</ul>
    <p4>
        As the name of the program suggests, we will be imitating rolling dice. 
        <br>This is one of the interesting python projects and will generate a random number for each dices the program runs, and the users can use the dice repeatedly for as long as he wants.
        <br>When the user rolls the dice, the program will generate a random number between 1 and 6 (as on a standard dice).
        <br>The number will then be displayed to the user. 
        <br>It will also ask users if they would like to roll the dice again. 
        <br>The program should also include a function that can randomly grab a number between 1 to 6 and print it. 
        <br>This beginner-level python project allows you to explore programming fundamentals and different coding concepts.

<ul>
    <li5><p><b>Hangman Game</b></p></li5>
</ul>
    <p5>
        This is more of a “guess the word” game.
        <br>The core concepts you have to use while developing this project are variables, random, integer, strings, char, input and output, and boolean.
        <br>In the game, users have to enter letter guesses, and each user will have a limited number of guesses (a counter variable is needed for limiting the guesses).
        <br>The Hangman is among the most highly recommended projects to master python for beginners. 
        <br>You can create a pre-organized list of words that users can grab words from.
        <br>Also, you must include specific functions to check whether or not a user has entered a single letter or if the input letter is in the hidden word. 
        <br>So if the user has actually inputted a single letter, and to print the correct outcomes (letters).

<ul>
    <li6><p><b>Python Story Generator</b></p></li6>
</ul>
    <p6>
        Did you think the most complex way of using a random module in python is random sampling? 
        <br>This idea cannot be further from the truth. It is also possible to create random stories and even beyond using the random module. 
        <br>Here, the aim is to create a random story each time the user runs the program.
        <br>The story will be the same always but with little variation in the input.
        <br>This is a fun but exciting python project which will work wonders with beginners to gain confidence in python.
        <br>In a nutshell, the program will ask users for inputs such as the name of a place, action, etc., and then build a story around the data.

<ul>
    <li7><p><b>Rock, Paper, Scissors</b></p></li7>
</ul>
    <p7>
        If you are tired of having no playmate, then a 5-minute stint of rock, paper, scissors with the computer and designed by you, yourself will improve your mood.
        <br>We again use the random function here.
        <br>You make a move first and then the program makes one.
        <br>To indicate the move, you can either use a single alphabet or input an entire string.
        <br>A function will have to be set up to check the validity of the move.
        <br>Using another function, the winner of that round is decided.
        <br>You can then either give an option of playing again or decide a pre-determined number of moves in advance.
        <br>A scorekeeping function will also have to be created which will return the winner at the end.

<ul>
    <li8><p><b>Qr code generator</b></p></li8>
</ul>
    <p8>
        A Quick Response Code or a QR Code is a two-dimensional bar code used for its fast readability and comparatively large storage capacity. 
        <br>It consists of black squares arranged in a square grid on a white background.
        <br>Python has a library “qrcode” for generating QR code images. It can be installed using pip.

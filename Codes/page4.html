            The objective of this is to create a GUI based Library Management System.
            <br>To build this, you will need intermediate understanding of the SQLite API and its commands. 
            <br>Intermediate understanding of Tkinter library, Ttk module's Treeview, and basic understanding of messagebox module.

            The banking sector has many applications for programming and IT solutions.
            <br>If you're interested in working on a project for the banking sector, then you've come to the right place.
            <br>In this article, we'll talk about a detailed banking project in Python so you can get started with ease.
            <br>We've shared source code for our project so you can take inspiration from the same and create a Python-based solution for a bank. 
            <br>Let's begin.

        <p3>
            In the Student Management system Project in python, we will see a project that manages all the information of the students It includes managing data such as name.
            <br>Email-id, contact number, date of birth, which stream they are in, etc.
            <br>In this tutorial of the Python project, we will build a GUI-based Student Management System Project using.
            <br>Tkinter, SQLite3, tkcalendar, messagebox, and datetime and Ttk modules of the Tkinter library. 
            <br>It is an intermediate-level project, where you will learn how to use databases, and modules and make some great GUIs in Python and apply them in real life.

            In this tutorial, Inventory Management System Project In Python, we are going to learn about businesses such as types of goods and when to order.
            <br>Keeps track from purchase to sale. This technique of inventory management keeps track of adequate stock of the goods to satisfy the clients.
            <br>It helps in saving money and meeting the customer's demands. Hence for any business, it is important to maintain the supply chain.
            <br>The inventory management system project in python with source code is a GUI-based project that uses the Tkinter module and MYSQL server for programming.

            In this article, we are going to create a task management software in Python.
            <br>This software is going to be very useful for those who don't want to burden themselves with which task they have done and which they are left with.
            <br>Being a coder we have to keep in mind which competition is going on, which courses we are enrolled with, and which YouTube playlist are we following, and so on. 
            <br>This software is going to keep account of all such details in a secured manner so that only you have the access to your data.

            The Car Booking system project is written in Python.
            <br>The project file contains a python script (appointment.py, booking.py, display.py). 
            <br>This is a simple GUI based application which is very easy to understand and use. 
            <br>It uses Tkinter module for the GUI. Talking about the application, the user can easily book, view, update and delete appointments.
            <br>In order to book an appointment, the user has to enter the owner's name, age, gender, location, entry time and phone number. 
            <br>To view all the available appointment details, the user just has to click on the “Next Booking” button on the Display module. 
            <br>Remaining feature is about updating and deleting records. Simply by entering owner's name, the user can edit and update the details. 
            <br>The design is so simple that the user won't find any difficulties while working on it.
